# React Frontend
This is the static react frontend for my personal website. This project utilizes react hooks as opposed to class components.
### React Bootstrap
Majority of the styling has been done using react bootstrap, including for the card display for movies and books as well as for the navigation bar.
### React Star Rating Component
The variable star ratings are displayed using a third party library called [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-star-rating-component](react-star-rating-component).
### React Router
React Router is being used to display different 'pages' (technically components) based on the request path.
