# React Frontend
This is the static react frontend for my personal website. This project utilizes react hooks as opposed to class components.
### React Bootstrap
Majority of the styling has been done using react bootstrap, including for the card display for movies and books as well as for the navigation bar.
### React Router
React Router is being used to display different 'pages' (technically components) based on the request path.
### MediaCard
The media card component takes the id from the backend api and pulls media data via the TMDB API.
